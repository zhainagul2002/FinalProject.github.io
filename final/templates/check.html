					<h4 class="text_title">Daily Health Check</h4>
				<h4 class="text_text"><p>Our care and concern for each other will be evident in new ways this year. The daily health check is a critically important tool in our efforts to keep members of this community safe and healthy. Each of us—students, faculty and staff—are required to complete a daily health check using the online <a href="/daily">DAILY HEALTH CHECK</a> tool.</p>
				<p>Beginning Friday, Jan. 1 and continuing throughout the entirety of Winter Break, faculty, staff, graduate and professional students are expected to complete their daily health check if they reside on campus or are coming to campus on any day. Students, faculty and staff do not need to complete the daily health check when they did not plan to come on campus.</p>
				<p>COVID-19 tests will not be generated automatically for students based on symptoms entered into the daily health check. Students should call <a href="https://www.intelmed.kg/ru/bishkek/news/test-na-antitela-covid-19/">Bonetsky's Labaratory</a> at <b>+996-555-32-03-03 / +996-502-32-03-03 / +996-312-32-03-03</b> to make an appointment for a diagnostic test. Test results wil be available after 48 - 64 hours.
